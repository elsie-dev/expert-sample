             Hormonal Contraceptives help reduce the pain <br>
             Hormonal contraception works by levelling the normal ups and downs of the body's hormones, and by stopping an egg being released (ovulation).<br>
              This keeps the lining of the womb thin which reduces the pain when it comes away (a period).

                Which method is best for preventing pregnancy?

              <div class="faq-body">
                Nearly half of all pregnancies are unplanned (45%) – but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they are unwanted.

              If an unplanned pregnancy would be a big concern, the implant, the injection, the IUS and the IUD are the best at preventing pregnancies.  Because they are long acting, you don't need to remember to use them every day
              As long as they're taken correctly, the combined pill, the patch, the contraceptive ring, and the mini pill are also great at preventing pregnancies
              If you want to delay getting pregnant, but want to get pregnant within a few months, the combined pill, the patch, the contracepive ring, and the progestogen only pill might be suitable as they come out of the body's system very soon after they are stopped, meaning that levels of fertility return to normal very quickly and might help with planning or delaying getting pregnant
              If pregnancy could be a happy accident, condoms, the diaphragm, fertility awareness and withdrawal are generally less effective methods of contraception, and so could be suitable
              Currently, contraceptive options for men are limited to condoms, withdrawal, or sterilisation (which is permanent).  An unplanned pregnancy can cause stress for both both partners, and using contraception such as condoms is a way for men to have control over when they become a father.  Men can talk to their partners about when they would like to have a baby, and ask them about preferred methods of contraception

                The Combined Pill, The Patch or The Vaginal Ring can make breasts bigger, since these contain the hormone oestrogen.<br>
                Oestrogen can make breasts feel tender and swollen, particularly at first.

                <b>Is pregnancy possible?</b>
                Trans and non-binary people who were assigned female at birth (AFAB) can get pregnant if sperm can meet egg, i.e. someone with a womb and ovaries is having penetrative sex with someone who produces sperm.<br>
                It’s possible to become pregnant on masculinising hormones, even if periods have stopped
                It is not possible to get pregnant if the womb or ovaries have been removed.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Planning a pregnancy</b>
      Transmen and non-binary AFAB people with womb and ovaries can get pregnant and carry a baby.

      Masculinising gender-affirming hormones need to be stopped before trying to get pregnant, for two reasons:

      Androgens like testosterone tend to prevent ovulation
      Masculinising hormones would harm a developing baby

                Contraception After Having a Baby?

                <b>How soon can l get pregnant?</b>
                You can get pregnant as soon as <b>21</b>days after having a baby. It is possible to get pregnant before you have your first period and if you’re breastfeeding.

                <b>Which Method is not Suitable for Having a Baby?</b>
                The combined pill, contraceptive patch and vaginal ring should not be used in the first 3 weeks after having a baby. This is because the risk of blood clots is higher after giving birth.<br>
                 Those who have had uncomplicated births, with no risk factors for blood clots and who are not breastfeeding may be able to start as early as 21 days following birth. However, if you are at increased risk of blood clots, you may be advised to wait 6 weeks before starting one of these methods.<br>
                 Speak to your doctor or nurse who can advise you

                 The diaphragm is not recommended in the first 6 weeks because the cervix (neck of the womb) and vagina change shape and size during pregnancy and birth.  These changes make the diaphragm less good at preventing pregnancy

                <b>How Long Should l wait before getting pregnant again?</b>
                The advice is to ideally wait for 24 months, or at least 12 months, before becoming pregnant again. This is because if you get pregnant again quickly, the next baby might be too small, or be born too soon.

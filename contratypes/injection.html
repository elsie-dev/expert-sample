    <p class="p-welcome">The injection (or depo) is given as an injection into the bottom or thigh every three months.

        It contains a hormone called progestogen which is very similar to the body's own hormones.

        Long-lasting and convenient, it can stop periods temporarily.

    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
    <b>The injection does not cause infertility</b>
    When you come off the injection, fertility returns to normal in an average of 6 months, although it can be sooner or later than this.  It’s important to know that it’s less easy to get pregnant as you get older – it’s naturally harder to get pregnant over the age of 35 (although this can definitely still happen)

<br>
    <b>The body doesn't need a period once a month </b>
    The injection prevents the lining of the womb from building up – blood doesn’t build up inside, and it can help people feel more energetic if they are not losing iron each month in a period.  It can also be convenient to not have periods.
<br>
<br>
    <b>The injection is great for people who forget to take pills.</b>
    Because the injection is only every few months, it means they don’t have to rely on taking a pill every day.  Apps and text reminder services are available to help people remember when to schedule their next injection

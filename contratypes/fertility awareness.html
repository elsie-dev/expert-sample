    <p class="p-welcome">Fertility awareness (natural family planning) is a way of predicting ovulation, to work out when pregnancy is more likely

        The method involves recording signs of fertility such as body temperature, thickness of fluid in the vagina, and calculating fertile times from menstrual cycle dates.

        Teaching from a qualified fertility awareness teacher is recommended.

        Fertility awareness can be very effective (with daily monitoring)

    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
    <b>Are mobile phone apps reliable?</b>
    Fertility awareness apps indicate likely fertile times. There are hundreds of apps for monitoring periods, but most apps are unregulated.

To rely on fertility awareness, itis important to record two or more signs of fertility. For example, the Natural Cycles app records morning temperature as well as period dates. There has not yet been enough research to know how reliable this app is at preventing pregnancy.
<br>
<br>
    <b>Apps which only record period dates are not reliable enough to be used for contraception </b>
    This is because the time of ovulation can vary from month to month, and from person to person, depending on biological and lifestyle factors. To estimate the time of ovulation with accuracy, an app must have as much evidence as possible about the app user's period dates and other signs of fertility.
<br>
Apps are a really good way to learn more about your body and the menstrual cycle, but for pregnancy prevention, it is necessary to use one which records period dates and at least one more sign of fertility, such as temperature or vaginal fluid.

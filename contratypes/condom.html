    <body>
    <p class="p-welcome">There are both male and female condoms all designed for protection<br>
        Condoms are made from a very thin latex, synthetic nitrile, polyisoprene or polyurethane, and can be used for vaginal, oral and anal sex.<br>

        The size and fit of condoms on a penis is important so that they are comfortable and don't break or slip off.<br>

        Condoms are the only option that prevents pregnancy and STIs.

    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
    <b>Some feel anxious about keeping an erectio</b>
    Condoms can break because they come into contact with things like oil-based lubricants, vaginal medications, sharp fingernails, teeth, or jewellery. Using a water-based lubricant is important and can help prevent condoms breaking, particularly during anal sex.

    If condoms are too small they can break. There are many different sizes and brands to suit different penis length and thickness.

    If a condom is too loose it can slip off. After ejaculation, it's important to hold the condom down at the base of the penis while taking the penis out
<br>
<br>
    <b>If a condom breaks or comes off, emergency contraception might be needed</b>
    The morning after pill (emergency contraception) can be bought from pharmacies. GP surgeries, family planning clinics and sexual health clinics can also provide the emergency copper coil and morning after pills

<br>
    <b>Condoms have expiry dates. They can also weaken in different conditions, such as in hot places or in sunlight.</b>

    <p class="p-welcome">The progestogen-only pill (the mini-pill) is taken every single day without any breaks.

        It contains a hormone which is very similar to the body's own hormones.

        It needs to be taken at roughly the same time every day.

    <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
    <b>You need to take it at roughly the same time every day (within a 3 or 12 hour 'window', depending on the brand).</b>
    It's good to have a routine which reminds you to take the pill. An app or phone reminder might be useful.

    <b>Most don’t put on weight with the progestogen-only pill (POP)</b>
    The pill might make you feel more hungry. Most people stay the same weight – 1 in 10 put on weight, and 1 in 10 lose weight while they are on the pill

    <b>Not all pills are right for everyone</b>
    One pill might suit someone really well, and another might cause moodiness, hunger, nausea, or less desire for sex. There are different kinds of pills available, so it’s worth trying a few different brands of combined pill to find one which suits

    <b>Mood changes can happen on the POP e.g. depression, anger, tearfulness. Different brands of pill suit different people, so it's worth trying another if this happens</b>
    <b>The POP does not cause infertility</b>

    <body>
    <p class="p-welcome">There are both male and female condoms all designed for protection<br>
        Condoms are made from a very thin latex, synthetic nitrile, polyisoprene or polyurethane, and can be used for vaginal, oral and anal sex.<br>

        The size and fit of condoms on a penis is important so that they are comfortable and don't break or slip off.<br>

        Condoms are the only option that prevents pregnancy and STIs.
